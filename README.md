# YouTube Mp4 Downloader

This is an another easy Python project I made to improve my understanding in more of Python's libraries!

# How does it work
I made the default path to my folder don't forget to change it if you want to use it!

When you download the videos it will show you the title and the views then download it directly into your folder path.

# How to use it

    python main.py "<Youtube Video link>"

in the terminal

# Install pytube
Before running the code you need to install pytube simply by

    pip3 install pytube
